# Key generation for Orbs Node
The Orbs Node requires a standard Ethereum wallet to communicate with other nodes and send transactions to Ethereum (such as automatic rewards distribution). The Guardian operating the node will need to load this address with ETH for proper function. 
It is important to backup and securely store the private keys for this wallet. 

This guide provide one possible way to generate an Ethereum wallet using MyCrypto.

## Create a new wallet
One can create a new wallet using MyCrypto by choosing “Create New Wallet”.
Note - the Orbs Node needs the private key to communicate with other nodes and send transactions to Ethereum. Thus, it is not possible to use Hardware Wallet for that purpose (as they do not reveal the private keys).
